#Back-end TODO List:
 - To implement the share route
 - Implement the method to validate the required fields of the entity
 - Put the database connection string as a setting in the appsettings.json
 - Inspect the behaviour/expected response on the mock api (and adapt my api to have the same behaviour/response)
 - Implement route tests to check both api's (my and the provided one)
 - Publish my api in a free host that supports sqlite on it
